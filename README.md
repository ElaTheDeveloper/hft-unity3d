HappyFunTimes-Unity3D
=====================

<img src="src/images/screenshot.png" />

[HappyFunTimes](http://docs.happyfuntimes.net) is a system for making game with 10-100+ players.
Players connect using their phones. Nothing needs to be installed on there phone. They can join
immediately.

The controllers are made with HTML5 so you can customize them all you want. There is a simple gamepad
controller included so you can get started without making a custom controller.
