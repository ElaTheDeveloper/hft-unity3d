HappyFunTimes-Unity3D
=====================

This is a sample Unity3D game for the [HappyFunTimes party games system](http://greggman.github.io/HappyFunTimes).

This one emulates a bunch of simple controllers. This allows you to get started with HappyFunTimes in
your Unity project very quickly.

The included sample is basically [the 2D platformer example](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/2d) from the
unity website with HappyFunTimes control added as well as a generic controller.

Players that fall of the bottom or edges are respawned
